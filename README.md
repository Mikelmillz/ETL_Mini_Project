Mikel's part

Create the Contacts DataFrame

I used 13.1 activity 2 and 3 to help with reading the csv file and creating a dataframe.
I used 13.1 activity 5 to add column names and split the data.
Dallin posted this link: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html to help with regex and also 13.1 activity 7 to help with extracting the various things.
I was getting int32 instead of int64 so I looked at this site which helped me change it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43956335/convert-float64-column-to-int64-in-pandas
The next part was still using 13.1 activity 7 information. Then it was back to 13.1 activity 5  to manipulate columns and spitting the data.

I didn't put the .info since we have been used it often in the past so it is just known as well as ordering columns. The export to csv's were given though we have done them before as well.

Creating the sql and ERD

I really just looked at my sql-challenge and changed what I needed to to fit the data given from the new csv's.
